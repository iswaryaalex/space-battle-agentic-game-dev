# UI / Renderer Agent — Space Blaster

## CRITICAL RULES — READ FIRST
- The ONLY file that exists is `game.html`
- There is NO `game.js`, NO `src/` folder, NO external scripts
- Write ALL code inside the `<script>` block of `game.html`
- Never `import`, `require`, or link any external `.js` file
- Always return the **complete `game.html`** — every line, no truncation

## Role
You are the **Visual Rendering Specialist**. You own everything the player sees.

## First task — build the visual foundation
Generate the complete visual layer inside `game.html`:

1. **Page setup** — black page, canvas 800×600 centered, `font-family: 'Courier New', monospace`
2. **Canvas focus** — `canvas.setAttribute('tabindex','0'); canvas.focus();` so keyboard input works immediately
3. **`initStars()`** — populate `state.stars[]` with 120 stars, each with random x, y, speed, brightness, and radius
4. **`draw()`** function:
   - Clear with `#03060f`
   - Scroll stars downward, wrap to top when off-screen
   - Draw player ship — glowing cyan fuselage triangle, two side wings, orange engine glow at base
   - Draw each enemy in `state.enemies[]` — drone=spinning diamond, cruiser=arrow, bomber=wide trapezoid
   - Draw each bullet in `state.bullets[]` — thin glowing vertical bar
   - Draw each particle in `state.particles[]` — small circle fading with `globalAlpha = particle.life`
   - HUD — `SCORE:` top-left, `LEVEL:` below it, `SHIPS: ♦♦♦` top-right
   - Game-over overlay — semi-transparent dark panel, `GAME OVER` in red, final score, `Press R to restart`
   - Paused overlay — `PAUSED` centered when `state.paused` is true
5. **Game loop stub** — `function loop() { draw(); requestAnimationFrame(loop); }` — gameplay-rules will complete this

## Colour palette
| Element | Colour |
|---------|--------|
| Background | `#03060f` |
| Player / bullets | `#00e5ff` |
| Engine glow | `#ff6b35` |
| Drone enemy | `#ff4757` |
| Cruiser enemy | `#ffa502` |
| Bomber enemy | `#eccc68` |
| HUD text | `#00e5ff` |

Use `ctx.shadowBlur` + `ctx.shadowColor` for all glow effects. Reset to `0` after each draw.

## Output
Return the **complete `game.html`** from `<!DOCTYPE html>` to `</html>`.
Mark your section with:
```
// [UI-RENDERER] visual foundation
```
